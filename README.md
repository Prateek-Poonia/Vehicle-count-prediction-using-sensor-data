• Model Training and Testing: Acquire skills in partitioning data into training and 
testing sets, training predictive models, making predictions, and evaluating

The preprocessing steps applied to the vehicle count prediction model involve 
the following:
1. Data Loading: The vehicle count data is loaded from a CSV file into a Pandas 
DataFrame.
2. Feature Engineering: The 'Time' column is converted to a datetime format and 
set as the index. Similarly, the 'Date' column is converted to datetime format. 
The 'Date' column is then further converted into a numerical representation 
(Unix timestamp) to make it suitable for modeling. 
3. Feature Selection: Only the 'Date' column is selected as the feature ('x') for the 
model, representing the timestamp of each observation. The target variable ('y') 
is the 'vehicles' column, representing the count of vehicles.
4. Train-Test Split: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the 
train_test_split function from scikit-learn. This ensures that the model's 
performance is evaluated on unseen data.
5. Standardization: StandardScaler from scikit-learn is used to standardize the 
features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. This preprocessing 
step ensures that all features are on a similar scale, preventing any particular 
feature from dominating the model fitting process.
6. Model Training: The linear regression model is trained on the standardized 
training data using the fit method. This step involves finding the optimal 
coefficients for the linear equation that best fits the relationship between the 
input features and the target variable.
7. Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated on the testing set using Mean 
Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics. These metrics quantify the model's 
predictive performance and its ability to explain the variance in the target 
variable.
8. Logistic Regression: Additionally, a logistic regression model is trained and 
evaluated for binary classification of vehicle counts. This model is trained and 
evaluated using the same preprocessing steps as the linear regression model.
Preprocessing Techniques:
• Standardization: Standardizing features using techniques like StandardScaler to 
ensure uniformity in data scaling and mitigate the influence of feature 
magnitudes on model fitting.
• Imputation: Addressing missing values in the dataset through imputation 
strategies such as mean or median imputation to preserve data integrity and 
completeness.
• Dimensionality Reduction: Employing techniques like Linear Discriminant 
Analysis (LDA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and extract essential 
features for modeling.
. Model Evaluation and Performance Metrics:
• Evaluation of Linear Regression Model: Analyzing performance metrics such as 
MSE and R-squared on both training and testing datasets to gauge the model's 
predictive accuracy and goodness of fit.
• Evaluation of Logistic Regression Model: Assessing the accuracy of the Logistic 
Regression model for binary classification tasks on training and testing data.
Results and Discussion:
• Comparative Analysis: Comparing the performance of Linear Regression and 
Logistic Regression models based on evaluation metrics.
• Effectiveness of Preprocessing Techniques: Discussing the impact of 
preprocessing methods on model accuracy and highlighting best practices for 
data preprocessing.

limitations of predictive modeling techniques for vehicle count prediction.
